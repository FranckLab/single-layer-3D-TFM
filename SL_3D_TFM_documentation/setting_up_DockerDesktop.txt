~~~~~~~~~~~ Single-layer TPT-based Traction Force Microscopy ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instructions for running the FEniCS-based finite-element solver with Docker 
Desktop (tested on Win10 Ent 1803). 

Actions in the OS are indicated with "->" and entries in the command line 
start with "$" (do not include the $ in the command to run). Statements in 
"<>" are to be replaced with user-specific info (remove the "<>").

0. Having a VirtualBox (e.g. for Docker Toolbox) running may cause issues, 
   see https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started/. Uninstalling/disabling 
   may be required.

1.  Docker Desktop setup:
	a.  Download Docker Desktop version 2.x.x from 
                https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
            you will need to create a Docker Hub account (it is free) to download. 
	      -> Run the installer (leave 'Windows Containers' option unchecked)
	
	b.   Once installed, make sure files can be shared:
	      -> Go to "settings" (from the Docker tray icon) and the
                  "Resources -> File sharing" menu
	      -> If you have WSL2 installed, uncheck the "Use the WSL2 base engine" box 
              -> Select the drive(s) from which you wish to run FEniCS (where 
                  your data is) 

	c.   Also ensure Docker has sufficient system resources:
	      -> Go to "settings" (from the Docker tray icon) and the
                  "Resources -> Advanced" menu  
              -> Move sliders appropriately. I usually use 2 CPUs, 16+GB RAM, 
                  4 GB Swap, and 64 GB Disk image size (only about 8GB is needed)
