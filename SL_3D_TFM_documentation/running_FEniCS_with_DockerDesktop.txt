~~~~~~~~~~~ Single-layer TPT-based Traction Force Microscopy ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instructions for running the FEniCS-based finite-element solver with Docker 
Desktop (tested on Win10 Ent 1803). 

Actions in the OS are indicated with "->" and entries in the command line 
start with "$" (do not include the $ in the command to run). Statements in 
"<>" are to be replaced with user-specific info (remove the "<>").

0. Have Docker Desktop running and configured (see "setting_up_DockerDesktop.text")

1. Running the FEniCS project script from PowerShell:
	a.  Open Windows PowerShell ('PS') 
              -> start menu
              -> Windows PowerShell (opens a blue and white command line prompt)

	b.  Change to your TFM run folder 
                $cd <project directory> 
                (e.g. I use "cd C:\Users\<username>\Desktop\fenics_test\")

	c.  Every time a new PS instance is opened (so we don't add a security hole) 
            allow only that instance of PS to run scripts:
		$Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope process
    	        -> Confirm $Y (type 'Y' or 'A' and enter) at the prompt

	d.  Run the PS script with:
	        $.\run_sl_tfm_ps.ps1
            this should automatically find all multipoint files in the folder and 
            run all the time points processed in the Matlab runscript
