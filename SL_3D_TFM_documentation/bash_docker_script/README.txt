Versions of Windows before Windows 10 do not support Docker Desktop. Instead 
it may be possible to use Docker Toolbox. *nix OSes also support Docker via 
the shell (although I have not had a chance to test).

In these cases, the .sh script should replicate the functionality of the 
.ps1 script for Docker Desktop if is bash is used. The 
"run_FEniCS_instructions_DockerToolbox" file describes the most likely 
solution to get Docker working in this case (for Windows).
